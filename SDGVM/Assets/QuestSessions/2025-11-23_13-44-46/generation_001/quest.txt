I'm here to help you create a quest for international students about Russian national culture, using ComfyUI for creation. Based on your instructions, here's a story concept for a "Petrovskaia Village Horror" quest with the theme of "Peter the Great on Mars" and the objective of "Finding the Death of Koschei the Deathless".

This quaint settlement, established by the great Peter the First himself during his legendary journey to Mars, was unlike any other. The villagers were descendants of brave explorers who had followed their Tsar to the Red Planet.

However, peace and prosperity in Petrovskaia were soon disrupted when rumors began to spread about the return of an ancient evil - Koschei the Deathless. This legendary figure was said to be nearly invulnerable, with his immortal soul hidden deep within a series of nested matryoshka dolls.
