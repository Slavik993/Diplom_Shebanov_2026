          "nextNode": 2
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "text": "The Lady of Peter the Great is a legendary tale about a beautiful woman named Anna Mons, who was said to have saved Peter the Great's flagship, the Saint Peter, from sinking during a storm. The sailors believed that her love and devotion kept them safe.",

        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "text": "Anna Mons was a humble peasant girl who lived near the port. During a terrible storm, Peter the Great's flagship, the Saint Peter, was in grave danger of sinking. Anna saw the ship in distress and, filled with love for her homeland and its ruler, ran to the shore and prayed for their safety.",
      "options": [

        }
      ]
    },
    {
