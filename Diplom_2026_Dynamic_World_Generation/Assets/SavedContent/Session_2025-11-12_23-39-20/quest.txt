Hello there! It seems like you have shared an icon with me. The icon description suggests that it is meant to be used for welcoming military personnel in a garrison or encampment setting. The 2D style indicates that the image is two-dimensional and flat, while the size of 100 suggests that it may be a standard size for use in certain applications. Is there a specific question you have about this icon or military traditions in general? I'd be happy to help answer any queries you might have!
