To create a short dialogue between two characters using the given script as a base, you can follow these steps:

1. Create two new NPCs with similar scripts and names, let's call them `PeterTheFirstNPC` and `CossackNPC`.
2. Define their dialogues in separate arrays. For example:

```csharp
public Dialogue[] PeterDialogues = new Dialogue[] {
    new Dialogue { text = "Hello, brave Cossack! I've heard tales of your exploits on the Wild West." },
    new Dialogue { text = "Ah, Petre! Long time no see. How have you been surviving out here?" },
    // Add more dialogues as needed
};

public Dialogue[] CossackDialogues = new Dialogue[] {
    new Dialogue { text = "Greetings, Tsar Peter! I've heard of your great deeds in Moscow." },
    new Dialogue { text = "Fair weather, Your Majesty. Tell me, how do you find life on the Wild West?" },
    // Add more dialogues as needed
};
```

3. In each NPC's `Start()` method, set their initial dialogue index to 0:

```csharp
void Start()
{
    dialogBox.SetActive(false);
    currentDialogueIndex = 0;
}
```

4. When defining the interaction between these two NPCs, you can create a new method in each NPC script that sets the other NPC's dialogue index:

```csharp
public void SetOtherNPCDialogue(GameObject otherNPC)
{
    otherNPC.GetComponent<PeterTheFirstNPC>().currentDialogueIndex++; // For PeterTheFirstNPC
    otherNPC.GetComponent<CossackNPC>().currentDialogueIndex++; // For CossackNPC
}
```

5. In the `Interact()` method of each NPC, check if the other NPC is nearby and call their `SetOtherN
