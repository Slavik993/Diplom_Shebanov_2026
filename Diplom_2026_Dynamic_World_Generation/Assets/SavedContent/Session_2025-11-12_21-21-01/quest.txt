Hello! It seems you have shared an icon with me. This icon represents "9 May - Day of Victory." In many countries, including Russia, this day is celebrated as the anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. The number "9 May" is written in the international date format, and the "2D" style suggests that this is a two-dimensional image. The size of the icon is 100 units. Is there any specific information you were looking for related to this Day of Victory or the icon itself? I'd be happy to help answer any questions you might have!
