I'd be happy to help you plan your visit to the Red Square to see the parade. The Red Square is a historic site located in Moscow, Russia. It has great cultural significance and is famous for its architectural masterpieces such as St. Basil's Cathedral and the State Historical Museum.

The parades held at the Red Square are usually military or Victory Day Parades. These events showcase the military might and unity of the nation. The best time to visit would be during these occasions if you're interested in seeing a grand spectacle. However, if you're planning a regular visit, I recommend checking the local tourist office for opening hours of the attractions and any potential closures due to events.

To get there, you can take public transportation like the metro or buses. Alternatively, taxis are also readily available. Make sure to check the current COVID-19 guidelines and restrictions before your visit. I hope this information helps you plan your trip! Let me know if you have any other questions.
